[h1]--- Simple changes ---[/h1]

I made this mod to improve the inconvenience of playing games based on my experience.
It may be OP, or not very helpful.

Add Thing(s)

Improved Shelf (also applied small one)
- No Quality that increase your colony wealth unnecessarily
- Slowness when moving up the shelf is 10% (Existing 50%)
- Standable ([strike]Can mine stone behind[/strike] or stay on shelf when pawn drafted etc..)

It's my first mod to practice modding/coding,
so there may be no more update if I'm satisfied with game :P

If it is updated, the Unified edition and single edition will go up both. (This page would be Unified edition for vanilla.)
